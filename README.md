Atomic is a "skeleton" template for Joomla 3. It's a slim template with the ability to enable/disable the various libraries in Joomla or add your own. It's for Joomla users who want a basic starting point for creating their own custom Joomla template.

It includes the following frameworks and each is customizable:

-Bootstrap 4  
-jQuery  
-Google Fonts  
-Font Awesome icons  

You can load all of these locally from your server or from their respective CDNs. Atomic also has the following module positions predefined:

Page header  
Top navigation  
Above body  
Left body | Right body  
Below body  
Footer  

If you are moving from the Protostar template, just enable the setting to activate the positions and it'll be a seamless switch.

Atomic also contains ways you can add your own custom CSS using a file or directly into the configuration. You can also add custom page code and your Google Analytics ID.
